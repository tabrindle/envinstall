## The Problems

- It works on my computer
- "command not found"
- Development environments are always different
- Writing bespoke install scripts is a pain
- Multiple methods of installation can cause problems

## This solution

- Automate your setup from a clean start
- use envinfo reports from a template setup, or write your own
- everyone's setup is done the same way
- robots are faster than humans
